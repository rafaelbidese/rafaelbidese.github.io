I am a graduate student at <a href="/">Auburn University</a> where I am pursuing a PhD at the <a href="/">Biosystems Engineering Department</a> where I am researching applications of machine learning and deep learning to agriculture problems with my advisor <a href="/">Dr. Yin Bao</a>. I have received my BS in Electronics Engineering and my MS in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil) where I was advised by <a href="/">Jefferson Brum Marques</a> and <a href="/">Djones Lettnin</a> respectively.

I have experience designing HW and integrating with SW for projects for the academia and the industry. More recently, I have been working on robotics, machine learning and deep learning for computer vision. I am currently working on projects that speed up breeding research trials using of deep learning as a tool for high-throughput plant phenotyping.

On my spare time I enjoy to practicing <a href="/">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a>, working on DIY projects and playing old computer games.
